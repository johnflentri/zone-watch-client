## Zone Watch

### `About this app`

Zone Watch is a location-based communication platform. The feature that distinguishes Zone Watch from other social media is the user's ability to filter their newsfeed by the zones they are subscribed to.

- Would you like to work together with your community to ensure fast communication?
- Do you want to be able to report suspicious activity to your neighbours?
- As a business owner, would you like to receive feedback from your customers?

Create an account and subscribe to your zones!

Upon log in, the user will receive an ordered list of zone channels, beginning with the closest in proximity based on their geo-location.

Users can also create a zone channel if one does not already exist for their intended purpose.
